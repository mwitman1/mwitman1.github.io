          <h2 class="post-title">Currently</h2>

          <p style="margin: 15px"> I started my postdoctoral research position in June 2019 at Sandia National Laboratories where I apply machine learning, data science, graph theory, atomistic simulations, and other computational techniques to improve our understanding (and the discovery) of novel materials for clean energy applications.</p>

          <h2 class="post-title">Early life</h2>
          <p style="margin: 15px"> I grew up in south eastern Pennsylvania and, thanks to my parents, developed a passion for the outdoors, traveling, and all things math and science.</p>
          
          <hr>

          <h2>Education</h2>
          <h5 class="text-muted"> University</h5>
          <p style="margin: 15px"> I attended the Schreyer Honors College at Penn State University from August 2009 through December 2013 studying chemical engineering. This was a great major because of the diverse topics that chemical engineers are equipped to work on, as well as the critical thinking and technical skills that come with any engineering degree. During a senior year computer science class, I discovered a new passion and found I had an aptitude for programming. This sparked an interest in computational related work that I have since sought to incorporate into my PhD program.</p>
          <h5 class="text-muted"> Study abroad</h5>
          <p style="margin: 15px"> While at Penn State I studied abroad at the University of Bath in the UK during the spring semester of 2011. This was an amazing opportunity to meet people from all over the world, many of whom I'm still in touch with today. In fact I met my wife there, who was also an Erasmus student at the time. Among innumerable benefits of study abroad, I had the unique and interesting opportunity to experience an education system outside of the US.</p>
          <h5 class="text-muted"> PhD</h5>
          <p style="margin: 15px"> At the end of my undergraduate degree I had an important choice to make between accepting a position immediately in industry or pursuing a PhD. After much consideration, I started as a PhD candidate at UC Berkeley in Fall 2014 because I felt this was the best way to develop my knowledge and skills at the intersection of computers, math, and science. Throughout the PhD program I've gained experience in what I've found to be a wide range of interesting scientific topics including statistics and statistical mechanics, graph theory, and machine learning (i.e. deep and reinforcement learning) and optimization. I've also gained technical experience in various programming languages, working with high performance computing systems, and generating, managing and analyzing large datasets. In general all these efforts have been focused around predicting materials for more energy efficient separations, as well as alternative energy applications like carbon dioxide capture or hydrogen storage. Additionally, the research process has taught me to efficiently work in teams and collaborate on projects, think critically about any new problem that is presented, be creative, and effectively identify areas in which new contributions can make an impact. Regardless of trajectory of my future pursuits, these skills will be invaluable in any environment.</p>

          <h2>Professional</h2>
          <h5 class="text-muted"> NSF-REU fellowhsip</h5>
          <p style="margin: 15px"> After returning from University of Bath, I got my first introduction into the research world with an REU fellowship to study organic electronics during the Summer of 2011 at PSU. I continued this research with my advisor, Dr. Enrique Gomez, throughout the remainder of my time as an undergraduate.</p>
          <h5 class="text-muted"> Co-op at Johnson and Johnson</h5>
          <p style="margin: 15px"> From June 2012 through December 2012 I worked in the supply chain organization for Janssen Pharmaceuticals, a Johnson & Johnson company. This was a great experience to gain exposure to how the business world operates, and I was able to participate in some very exciting projects. A main focus while there was to write VBA programs to automate data collection and analysis to significantly improve the accuracy and efficiency of various workflows. I consolidated, analyzed, and reported supply chain related metrics for the mutli-billion dollar Tier 1 product portfolio, the results of which were presented to the top levels of the executive leadership team. This was rewarding because of the high level of responsibility that I was given, and because our team knew that accurately generating and reporting this data had real impacts on people's ability to access the medications they needed. </p>
          <h5 class="text-muted"> Intern at GE Reuter Stokes</h5>
          <p style="margin: 15px"> In Summer 2013 I worked for a GE measurement company that built radiation detectors and measurement products. While only there for two months, I took some inspiration from my days at J&J and developed several VBA programs to improve the efficiency of various supply chain related problems at the company. The main project I worked on was a VBA program that interfaced with the data from a $20 M enterprise resource planning investment that was not being utilized efficiently when I arrived at the company.</p>
          <h5 class="text-muted"> Doctoral student at UC Berkeley</h5>
          <p style="margin: 15px"> From Fall 2014 to Spring 2019 I have been a PhD student at UC Berkeley in Berend Smit's group, applying statistics, math, and computer science techniques to computational chemistry and materials science topics. High-level summaries of my work can be found on my <a href="projects.html">Projects</a> page, with more detailed information available in the corresponding <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=bb7EKzIAAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank">publications</a>.</p>
          <h5 class="text-muted"> Visiting researcher at  &#201;cole Polytechnique F&#233;d&#233;rale de Lausanne</h5>
          <p style="margin: 15px"> Another aspect of the PhD that I've found very rewarding is the collaborative aspects of my research. After my advisor moved from Berkeley to EPFL in Switzerland, I've had the chance to work in both places and forge international collaborations. Working with experts from around the world in the UK, Norway, Switzerland, Spain, and the US has been really exciting.</p>

          <h2>Skills</h2>
          <h5 class="text-muted"> Programming</h5>
          <p style="margin: 15px"> I use Python and Bash every day, as well as C/C++ and Fortran when I need to modify open source codes such as RASPA (C), LAMMPS (C++), LammpsInterface (Python), Zeo++ (C++), and AMP (Fortran/Python) to implement new functionalities. Most recently, I've been working with the machine learning package AMP for which I've contributed new functionality and bug fixes. I'm currently very interested in using this code as well as my own codes to apply supervised and reinforcement learning principles in computational chemistry. In another recent project, I created a Python implementation of the elegant Balcioglu and Wood algorithm to solve the all near min-cut problem (a capability currently missing in Python's NetworkX library) to mathematically formalize important properties of crystal surfaces and correlate them with experimentally known 2D materials. I occasionally use Matlab/Mathematica in special situations, usually for building toy model systems that support my research. At various times I've also worked with SQL, Java, HTML/CSS, and Julia which has given me a basic familiarity with these languages. Another new hobby of mine is to use Blender and its Python scripting functionality to make artistic visualizations of my research, as well as creating a collection of original works of <a href="art.html">digital art</a>. 
          <h5 class="text-muted"> Writing and communication</h5>
          <p style="margin: 15px"> My technical writing skills have been refined through the 8 publications I've authored or co-authored to date, and you can take a look at my <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=bb7EKzIAAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank">Google Scholar</a> for some examples. I've also presented my research at conferences and have experience in scientific communication to audiences at varying technical levels.
          <h5 class="text-muted"> Collaboration</h5>
          <p style="margin: 15px"> I've taken initiatives to work on and organize international research collaborations, which has been one of the most rewarding aspects of my PhD. I'm proficient with GitHub for remote technical collaborations and code development.
          <h5 class="text-muted"> Classes</h5>
          <p style="margin: 15px"> In addition to the graduate statistical mechanics, math, and chemical engineering classes, I've taken a variety of courses on Coursera in Machine Learning and data science. In Fall 2018 I'm taking the Deep Reinforcement Learning class and will be writing a series of blog posts about some of the work I do as part of the class.

          <h2>Extracurriculars</h2>
          <h5 class="text-muted"> Outdoor Adventures</h5>
          <p style="margin: 15px"> Exploring the outdoors, snowboarding, hiking, and increasingly mountaineering are some of my favorite passions. Inspired by the likes of the <a href="https://www.outdoorproject.com" target="_blank">Outdoor Project</a>, I've started to make blog posts about some of the more interesting <a href="adventures.html">Adventures</a> I've discovered, additionally filming parts of them with an action camera. I always appreciate reading information like this on other people’s blogs, so I'm posting them on this site in the event that others may find them useful as well.
          <h5 class="text-muted"> Community outreach</h5>
          <p style="margin: 15px"> One of the great programs that UC Berkeley graduate students participate in is the BASIS program, whose mission is to promote interest in science among young minds in the Bay Area. For this we periodically travel to elementary school classrooms throughout the school year and walk the students through simple experiments designed to pique their interests in science and foster their curiosity about the world around them.</p> 
          <p style="margin: 15px"> Recently a fellow graduate student had an awesome idea of developing a science themed coloring book for the BASIS program, and I am working on applying some image processing and machine learning techniques to automatically generate these coloring book images from interesting cover art published in the literature. Check out my <a href="posts/colorbooked.html">blog post</a> about it here. Our goal is to produce a periodic publication of the coloring book both online and in print.</p>
          <h5 class="text-muted"> Sports, art, and music</h5>
          <p style="margin: 15px"> I like running and soccer and enjoy participating in various leagues in the Bay Area and Switzerland. I've played the saxophone since 5th grade and played extensively in the volleyball and basketball pep bands at Penn State. In the past I have worked with art mediums that are non-digital (painting, sketching, etc), but recently I've enjoyed using my programming skills to creating digital art. I have been particularly impressed by Deepart.io and now want to learn more about the intersection of machine learning and art.

          <h2>The future</h2>
          <p style="margin: 15px"> After my PhD is completed, I look forward to new, exciting, and challenging opportunities, either in business/industry in a data science related role or in a post-doctoral position. I'm excited to embark on future pursuits that will allow me to work with great people, continue to learn new skills, and provide opportunities to make significant contributions to society and the institution that I'm a part of.</p>
