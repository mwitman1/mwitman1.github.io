          <h2 class="post-title">Current Status</h2>

          <p style="margin: 15px"> I will most likely be finishing my PhD in May 2019 (possibly December 2018), seeking a data science related job as my first experience out of graduate school.</p>

          <h2 class="post-title">Early life</h2>
          <p style="margin: 15px"> I grew up in south eastern Pennsylvania and thanks to my parents that came with a love for the outdoors, traveling, and all things science.</p>

          <h2>Education</h2>
          <h5 class="text-muted"> University</h5>
          <p style="margin: 15px"> I attended Penn State University August 2009 - December 2013 studying chemical engineering. This was a great major because of the diverse topics that chemical engineers are equipped to work on, as well as the critical thinking and technical skills that come with any engineering degree. In the last semester I finally took a computer science class. While I have no regrets on my degree choice, this sparked an interest in computational related work that, had I perhaps known about towards the beginning of my undergraduate program, may have driven me into more of a math/computer science field.</p>
          <h5 class="text-muted"> Study abroad</h5>
          <p style="margin: 15px"> While at Penn State I studied abroad the at the University of Bath in the UK for the spring semester of 2011. This was an amazing experience to meet people from all over the world, many of whom I'm still in touch with today. In fact I met my now wife there (who was also on Erasmus). It was also interesting to experience the education system outside of the US.</p>
          <h5 class="text-muted"> PhD</h5>
          <p style="margin: 15px"> At the end of my undergraduate degree I had a big choice to make between industry or a PhD. In the end I started a PhD at UC Berkeley in Fall 2014 because I felt this was the best way to develop my skill set to be at the intersection of computers, math, and science. I'm not sure that this would have been as feasible had I gone straight into in industry based on only the traditional undergraduate chemical engineering knowledge I had at the time. Throughout the PhD I've gained experience in what I've found to be a wide range of interesting scientific topics ranging from statistics and statistical mechanics to graph theory to machine learning (nerual networks) and optimization. I've also gained technical experience in various programming languages, working with high performance computing systems, and generating/managing/analyzing large datasets. In general all these efforts have been focused around predicting materials for more energy efficient separations, as well as alternative energy applications like carbon dioxide capture or hydrogen storage. I think most importantly the PhD has taught me to efficiently work in teams and collaborate on research projects, think critically about any new problem that is presented, be creative, and effectively identify areas in which new contributions can make an impact. Regardless of where I end up in my career I think these are the things that will help the most moving forward.</p>

          <h2>Professional</h2>
          <h5 class="text-muted"> NSF-REU fellowhsip</h5>
          <p style="margin: 15px"> After returning from University of Bath I got my first introduction into the research world with the REU fellowship to study organic electronics during the Summer 2011 at PSU. I continued this research with Dr. Gomez throughout the remainder of my time as an undergraduate.</p>
          <h5 class="text-muted"> Co-op at Johson and Johnson</h5>
          <p style="margin: 15px"> From June 2012 - December 2012 I worked in the supply chain organization for Janssen Pharmaceuticals (the Johnson & Johnson company). This was a great experience to get a taste of how the business world operates, and I was able to participate in some very exciting projects. One of my main focuses while I was there was writing VBA programs to automate data collection and analysis to significantly improve the accuracy/efficiency of various workflows. I was placed in charge of consolidating, analyzing, and reporting supply chain related metrics for $BB worth of Tier 1 product sales that went all the way to the executive leadership team. This was rewarding because of the responsibility I was given and because our team knew that accurately generating and reporting this data had real impacts on people's ability to access the medications they needed. </p>
          <h5 class="text-muted"> Intern at GE Reuter Stokes</h5>
          <p style="margin: 15px"> In Summer 2013 I worked for a GE measurement company that built radiation detectors and measurement products. While only there for two months, I took some inspiration from my days at J&J and developed several VBA programs to improve the efficiency of various supply chain related problems at the company. The main project I worked on was a VBA program that interfaced with the data from a $20 M enterprise resource planning investment that at the time was not being utilized efficiently.</p>
          <h5 class="text-muted"> Doctoral student</h5>
          <p style="margin: 15px"> More info above. Another aspect of the PhD that I've found very rewarding is the chance to engage in meaningful collaborations. After my advisor moved from Berkeley to EPFL in Switzerland, I've had the chance to work in both places and forge international collaborations. Working with experts from around the world in the UK, Norway, Switzerland, Spain, and the US has been really exciting.</p>
          <h5 class="text-muted"> Additional info</h5>
          <p style="margin: 15px"> Check out my <a href="projects.html">Projects</a> page, LinkedIn, github, resume, etc. for more information about some of things I've been working on (especially the recent projects).</p>

          <h2>Skills</h2>
          <h5 class="text-muted"> Programming</h5>
          <p style="margin: 15px"> I use Python and Bash pretty much everyday. I have some experience in C/C++ and Fortran when I need to modify open source codes such as RASPA (C), LAMMPS (C++), Zeo++ (C++), and AMP (Fortran/Python) to implement new functionalities. Most recently I've been working a bit with AMP and have contributed bug fixes and am working on adding in some new features to this machine learning package. I occaisionally use Matlab/Mathematica for special needs. I've also touched things like SQL, Java, and Julia but am much less familiar with these. Some of my work I've published on my github page. I think my favorite one is a Python implementation of the elegant algorithm to solve the all near min cut problem described by Balcioglu and Wood. This adds a computational capability currently missing in Python's NetworkX library. As a fun side project I wanted to create this website so I learned the HTML basics. As another side project I enjoy Python programming in Blender for making visualizations related to my work as well as digital art.
          <h5 class="text-muted"> Writing and communication</h5>
          <p style="margin: 15px"> For now I've had the chance to author or co-author 9 publications, so I've had plenty of time to polish my technical writing and you can take a look at my Google Scholar for some examples. I've also presented my research at conferences and have experience in scientific communication.
          <h5 class="text-muted"> Collaboration</h5>
          <p style="margin: 15px"> I've worked on and organized international research collaborations, also using GitHub for specific technical collaborations.
          <h5 class="text-muted"> Classes</h5>
          <p style="margin: 15px"> After taking the fundamental graduate level chemical engineering and statistical mechanics classes at Berkeley I started traveling periodically to Switzerland for work so that has made taking extra classes difficult. I've taken the online Inroduction to Machine Learning on Coursera and am starting the deeplearning.ai specialization. For the last year of the PhD I will mostly be in Berkeley so I'm getting the chance to take a Deep Reinforcement Learning class in Fall 2018 which I'm really excited about, and hopefully I can find one more interesting class for Spring 2018.

          <h2>Extracurriculars</h2>
          <h5 class="text-muted"> Outdoor Adventures</h5>
          <p style="margin: 15px"> Exploring the outdoors, snowboarding, hiking, and increasingly mountaineering are some of my favorite passions. Inspired by the likes of the <a href=https://www.outdoorproject.com/>Outdoor Project</a>, I've started to make little blog posts about some of the more interesting <a href="adventures.html">Adventures</a> I've discovered and even more recently started filming parts of them with an action camera. I always appreciate reading information like this so maybe someone else will see these videos and find them useful as well.
          <h5 class="text-muted"> Community outreach</h5>
          <p style="margin: 15px"> One of the great programs that UC Berkeley graduate students participate in is the BASIS program which is targeted to engaging young minds in the Bay Area with science. For this we periodically travel to elementary school classrooms throughout the school year and walk the students through simple experiments designed to pique their interests in science and the world around them.</p> 
          <p style="margin: 15px"> Recently a fellow grad student has had an awesome idea of developing a science themed coloring book for the BASIS program, and I am working on applying some image processing/machine learning techniques to automatically generate these coloring book images from interesting cover art published in the literature. This way we could potentially come out with a periodic publication of such a coloring book (maybe even in print with a bit of funding).</p> 
          <h5 class="text-muted"> Sports, art, and music</h5>
          <p style="margin: 15px"> I like running and soccer and enjoy participating in various leagues in the Bay Area and Switzerland. I've played the saxophone since 5th grade and played in the volleyball and basketball pep bands at Penn State which was a lot of fun. Traditionally I have worked with art mediums that are non-digital, but recently I'm enjoying getting into digital art (i.e. with Blender). I was particularly amazed by <a href="https://deepart.io/#">Deepart.io</a> and now want to learn more about the intersection of machine learning and art.

          <h2>The future</h2>
          <p style="margin: 15px"> At the moment I haven't settled on a specific professional path quite yet. As I finish up the PhD by Summer 2019, I will need to make some big decsisions about my next step, but I know I will be very happy if I can find a pursuit that is challenging, involves working with great people, requires learning new skills, and makes a meaningful impact at my workplace and hopefully within society. And I think I these will be the guiding principles for as long as I am plotting my career path. For now I think the two things I would like to apply to are data science related positions, as well as a variety of post-doctoral positions.</p>
